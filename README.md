# OpenZeppelin Cryptographic Research

## Overview

The OpenZeppelin Research team would like to increase the cryptographic expertise amongst our members. This will widen the range of products that we are comfortable auditing as well as allow us to better understand and evaluate new security protocols and proposals. We intend to achieve this with individual research and open discussion.

This repository will be used to manage the project by tracking explanations, open questions and learning resources.

It will also serve as the basis for a _Cryptography for Blockchain Developers_ series of articles that will teach a generic programmer everything they need to know about cryptography as it used in blockchain applications.
