    "### The concept\n",
    "\n",
    "This article is a trap and you, dear reader, have fallen right in. I am not going to explain elliptic curves, at least not directly. I have a bias: I don't believe elliptic curves should be part of an _Introduction to blockchain cryptography_ series. They're certainly interesting, but they don't contain any important concepts. In principal, we could build an equally secure (but less efficient) blockchain without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that this **seems** wrong. You're here to learn about blockchain cryptography and if you don't know anything about elliptic curves, you probably feel like you're missing something crucial. There are lots of protocols and projects in this space that depend on ECDSA signatures, Pedersen commitments, secret sharing schemes and many more algorithms that all seem to rely on elliptic curves. In fact, I've heard multiple people refer to some version of [the world of elliptic curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IP1xXlEVls&feature=youtu.be&t=578) as a shorthand for this whole industry. However, if you jump straight into performing calculations on elliptic curves there is a risk that you end up thinking: \"sure, I can see what you're doing, but what does any of this have to do with cryptography?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So the goal of this article is to develop some intuition on the role of elliptic curves, mostly by ignoring them, and then refer you to any of the many resources that dive into the details. [This one](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/) strikes an excellent balance between clarity and completeness.\n",

The elliptic curve groups, however, are not susceptible to this algorithm. Their inscrutability is their advantage, because they have minimal unnecessary structure. Since the security of a system is limited by the best possible attack, this means that elliptic curve groups can achieve the same security with smaller key sizes than would be required in the equivalent integers-modulo-a-prime group.\n",
